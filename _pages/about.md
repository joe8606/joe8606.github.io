Hi, I'm **Shang-Yi Lin**. When I heard Bill Gates say, "I choose a lazy person to do a hard job because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it," I realized that's exactly who I am in the world of data. Currently, I'm a Logistic Data Analytics Intern at [Awesung Tech](https://www.awesung.com/). My journey has taken me through the healthcare and logistics industries, where I find great joy in solving messy data problems that others prefer to avoid.

I have 2 years of professional experience. In Taiwan, I worked as a Data Analyst at Taiwan CDC, where I built **ML-driven healthcare solutions** to optimize influenza vaccine usage prediction. I also developed **ETL automation tools and monitoring systems**, significantly reducing communication overhead and report generation time.

At Rutgers, I participated in the **Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) Data Challenge**, where I designed a fine-tuned Llama 3.2 workflow to normalize internal data, ultimately winning the competition.

Beyond data science, I'm passionate about sports and hiking. I am also a member of the [Rutgers Meditation Club](https://www.instagram.com/rumeditationclub/?hl=en), always seeking my own focus and peace.

Reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shang-yi-lin-728725262/) or check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/joe8606).

Looking forward to our paths crossing,

Shang-Yi
