# **SHANG-YI LIN**
Data Scientist | Logistic Data Analytics Intern @ [Awesung Tech](https://www.awesung.com/)

Hi, I'm **Shang-Yi Lin**. In the complex world of data, I strive to find the shortest path to insight. Currently, I'm a Logistic Data Analytics Intern at [Awesung Tech](https://www.awesung.com/) and a second-year MSDS student at Rutgers University, maintaining a **GPA of 3.9**.

I have 2 years of professional experience. In Taiwan, I worked as a Data Analyst at Taiwan CDC, where I built **ML-driven healthcare solutions** to optimize influenza vaccine usage prediction. I also developed **ETL automation tools and monitoring systems**, significantly reducing communication overhead and report generation time.

At Rutgers, I participated in the **Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) Data Challenge**, where I designed a fine-tuned Llama 3.2 workflow to normalize internal data, ultimately winning the competition.

Beyond data science, I'm passionate about sports and hiking. I am also a member of the [Rutgers Meditation Club](https://www.instagram.com/rumeditationclub/?hl=en), always seeking my own focus and peace.

Reach out to me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/shang-yi-lin-728725262) or check out my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/joe8606).

Looking forward to our paths crossing,

Shang-Yi
